To get this to run, navigate to the root of the project and do `sbt run`. 

Compiled binary is in target/scala-2.11/interpreter-out

Scala Native is still in very early stages of development so some features of the interpreter such as a REPL don't work. However, once these features get merged upstream, I will include them into this project. 

If you would like to run the REPL on the JVM, you can do so by running this project like how you would any other Scala project. First, you have to un-comment the features.
